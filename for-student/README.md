# TEXT FILE GRADER for students

## Background

This is a bash script I used when I was taking Quantum Mechanics online. My professor would keep a copy of grades in Excel and I would keep them in tab delineated files.

It came in handy because upon one occasion, he made a mistake in his weighing method, and I was able to spot it because my average on my computer was different than his.

## Usage

Write up your files, and change the names in the script as appropriate. You will also need to adjust the weights in the code. Then execute `program` and it will output each category's average as well as a total average
